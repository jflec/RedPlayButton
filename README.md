## Project Challenge

My main challenge when tackling this project was successfuly linking AWS to the code, I hadn't touched the technology prior and the idea was daunting. After a brief period of trial and error I was finally able to upload/playback videos, using this same technology I will implement functionality that will allow users to upload a channel picture and banner.

## Upcoming Features

* Ability to like/dislike videos/comments
* Upload channel picture and banner
